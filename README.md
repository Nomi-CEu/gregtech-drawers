About
==================
Gregtech Drawers is an addon for the [Storage Drawers](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/storage-drawers) mod by Texelsaur.  
It requires [GTCEu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/gregtech-ce-unofficial) as a dependency, and adds drawers for rubber and treated wood.

This mod is a fork of JOB10's [Storage Drawers Kappa Addon](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/storagedrawerskappa), and uses its main code. This removes all of the integrations there, and replaces it with GT integration. The code there is very flexible, and can be used to create other drawer types. Go there for more information. 

Please note that JOB10's repo is itself a fork of Raptor's [Storage Drawers Unlimited](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/storage-drawers-unlimited). We have used JOB10's fork, as it has some fixes over the original mod, which has been abandoned for 1.12.
